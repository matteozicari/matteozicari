# Hi, it's Matteo!! 🤙🏻

📚 I'm currently a MSc Finance student at Tilburg University, and I have recently defended my thesis titled "Is Startup Success Predictable? New Evidence Based on Machine Learning" in which I leveraged machine learning to develop a tool for identifying successful startups. My main focus was Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, as well as interpretation techniques like LIME and SHAP.

🎙️ I'm about to launch my own podcast, [Inside People Podcast with Matteo Zicari](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/insidepeoplepodcast), in which I'll be discussing the unknown and how challenging it can be to truly connect with people and navigate life. I genuinely believe that listening to people's stories and being truly interested in someone else's journey are key to finding inspiration and pursuing our passions. The goal is to break down people’s stories, demystify the distorted image we have of others, and empathise with them. To go about this world we should truly connect and care.
