# Hi, it's Matteo!! 🤙🏻

📚 I'm currently a MSc Finance student at Tilburg University, and I have recently defended my thesis titled "Is Startup Success Predictable? New Evidence Based on Machine Learning" in which I leveraged machine learning to develop a tool for identifying successful startups. My main focus was Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, as well as interpretation techniques like LIME and SHAP.

💻 I am a research assistant at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com) where we help individual researchers, data scientists and their teams to efficiently work on empirical research projects. Our platform provides information about workflow and data management and tutorials that teach researchers how to organize and document their data and code. That way, our research becomes sustainable and reproducible, leading to time savings and transparency.



🎙️ I'm about to launch my own podcast, [Inside People Podcast with Matteo Zicari](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/insidepeoplepodcast), in which I'll be discussing the unknown and how challenging it can be to truly connect with people and navigate life. I genuinely believe that listening to people's stories and being truly interested in someone else's journey are key to finding inspiration and pursuing our passions. The goal is to break down people’s stories, demystify the distorted image we have of others, and empathise with them. To go about this world we should truly connect and care.
